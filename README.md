## Project Overview

### Application Description
The main goal of this project is to familiarise software development using SCRUM, and at the same time to deliver  a three-tier system.
The application should meet all the acceptance criteria listed in the project backlog and make sure the basic CRUD functionalities for both Users and Component work properly.

## Sprint Breakdowns

### Sprint 1: 1/12/2020


**Sprint Overview**

In my first sprint, my goal was to setup my project and create the relevant database tables that will work with my business layer. I created the three-tier system and began to iteratively work through the three layers with small progress.


**Sprint Goals**
- [x] Complete User Story 0.1
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2
- [x] Complete User Story 0.3
- [x] Update README.md


**Sprint Review**

I began creating the application by using the database-first approach and set up all the relevant tables and its attributes. I also partially worked on the main entitites in my login/ register page to prepare for my User functions for Sprint 2. The last thing I worked on was the Create functions for all my tables.


**Sprint Retrospective**

I have underestimated with the workload that I gave to myself and didn't manage my time too well, and eventually I worked over-time to complete my Sprint. To improve for Sprint 2 I need to be able to manage my time better by coming up with a plan that balances with how much I work and make sure I take regular small breaks to prevent procrastination from working too much/ being stuck at a problem for too long.

### Sprint 2: 2/12/2020

**Sprint Overview**

For my second sprint, my goal was to complete creating user and logging in, due to being stuck at a logic error for too long. I wasn't able to progress much further and able to complete 2 of my user stories, when i intended to finish 4.
