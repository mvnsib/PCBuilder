## Project Overview

### Application Description
The main goal of this project is to familiarise software development using SCRUM, and at the same time to deliver  a three-tier system.
The application should meet all the acceptance criteria listed in the project backlog and make sure the basic CRUD functionalities for both Users and Component work properly.

## Sprint Breakdowns

### Sprint 1: 1/12/2020


**Sprint Overview**

In my first sprint, my goal was to setup my project and create the relevant database tables that will work with my business layer. I created the three-tier system and began to iteratively work through the three layers with small progress.


**Sprint Goals**
- [x] Complete User Story 0.1
- [x] Complete User Story 0.2
- [x] Complete User Story 0.3
- [x] Update README.md


**Sprint Review**

I began creating the application by using the database-first approach and set up all the relevant tables and its attributes. I also partially worked on the main entitites in my login/ register page to prepare for my User functions for Sprint 2. The last thing I worked on was the Create functions for all my tables.


**Sprint Retrospective**

I have underestimated with the workload that I gave to myself and didn't manage my time too well, and eventually I worked over-time to complete my Sprint. To improve for Sprint 2 I need to be able to manage my time better by coming up with a plan that balances with how much I work and make sure I take regular small breaks to prevent procrastination from working too much/ being stuck at a problem for too long.

### Sprint 2: 2/12/2020

**Sprint Overview**

For my second sprint, my goal was to complete creating user and logging in, due to being stuck at a logic error for too long. I wasn't able to progress much further and able to complete 2 of my user stories, when i intended to finish 4.

**Sprint Goals**

- [x] Update README.md
- [x] Complete User story 1,1
- [x] Complete User story 1.1.1
- [ ] Complete User story 1.1.2
- [ ] Complete User story 1.2
- [ ] Push code to Git
- [x] Complete the wireframe for User story 0.3

**Sprint Review**

I began to work on the front-end and the back-end of creating the user, I've designed a simple GUI for the Sign in/ up pages and created a few validation so my program queries the user registration properly. The last thing I made was the remaining CRUD functions for the User and other components (e.g. CPU, Motherboard, etc...).


**Sprint Retrospective**

Just as Sprint 1, I have underestimated my program, and eventually I was stuck at a problem for far too long. I had a simple logic error with the username validation, and I spent too long to debug the problem rather than move on to the next work and iterate through the error again. For the next sprint I now know better to move on and return to get as much work done as possible. At the same time I want to prioritize the front-end and back-end of my project and focus on Testing through the weekend.


### Sprint 3: 3/12/2020

**Sprint Overview**
In this sprint, I mainly focused on finishing the few Goals that was left from Sprint 2, and managed to get ahead. I managed to complete my first epics which is allowing the user to sign up and sign in to their account and being redirected to the main menu. Eventually I had a few Errors with my code and invested too much time on errors that doesn't have a huge impact on the program. I should be focusing on getting the user stories done than perfecting each user story. 

**Sprint Goals**

- [x] Update README.md (Sprint 2)
- [x] Complete User story 1.1.2
- [x] Complete User story 1.1.3
- [ ] Complete User story 1.2
- [x] Start User story 4: design a basic layout of the GUI
- [x] Push code to Git


**Sprint Review**

I began my sprint by updating my README.md, after spending some time on that I focused on getting my first user story from yesterday done, which was User story 1.1.2: User's private credential. This didn't take me too long as it was just simple validation and making sure that the user enters a number and more than 6 characters for their password, in order to keep their account more safe. I then focused on my second acceptance criteria which was replacing the characters with a * to keep the password hidden. Unfortunately my password box wouldn't recognise any text, so I decided to stick with the text box. Overall I couldn't complete all the user stories, since I was ill and distracted with small issues in my program.

**Sprint Retrospective**

In order to do better and get this project done, I need to focus less on perfecting the simple things like the GUI and not overcomplicate the validation. I shouldn't have spent 2 days on the login menu and focus on testing towards the end. For tomorrow and saturday I should 100% focus on the main component classes.

### Sprint 4: 4/12/2020

**Sprint Overview**

In this sprint I plan to complete the CRUD methods for the 4 components table. I also plan on working with my GUI and create 8 different windows for adding and updating the components. I'm mainly focusing on the main features of my program as the due date is coming closer. And if I end up not finishing my Sprint, I will make sure the GUI is designed and my back-end is done, so all I have left to do over the weekend would be to refine the GUI, connect the frontend to the backend and finish up my unit testing.

**Sprint Goals**

- [ ] Complete User Story 2.1
- [x] Complete User Story 2.1.1
- [ ] Complete User Story 2.2
- [x] Complete User Story 2.3
- [ ] Complete User Story 3.1.1
- [x] Create the basic GUI layout for every button
- [x] Update README.md
- [ ] Push Code to Git

**Sprint Review**

I began my sprint by finishing the CRUD methods and instead of using 4 different CRUD classes, I combined them as one, as it works more efficiently and it doesn't require me to instanciate 4 different objects in the code behind the GUI. Once done, I was primarily focused on getting my GUI to work and make sure the buttons function properly. And lastly I added a listbox, but I haven't populated it since I haven't connected the frontend with the backend CRUD methods.

**Sprint Retrospective**

Throughout the day it was a short sprint as we started a bit later than usual, since we had to discuss about our presentation and we had our Friday stand-up, and on top of it we finished an hour earlier for the quiz, so that gave us a total of 4 hours to work for our Sprint and unfortunately I wasn't able to get a lot done, so I worked for a couple more hours to get most of the things done besides the testing for my CRUD methods and connecting the CRUD with the frontend.
